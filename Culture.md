## Culture

- [Assholes, Jerks and Dickheads Are People Too](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/assholes-jerks-dickheads-people-too-neil-mcgregor) - by Neil McGregor. Takeaway: "There is worrying trend on LinkedIn and in the business media in general. The labelling of people into categories labelled Assholes, Jerks and Dickheads. I have to say this worries me for a number of reasons, not the least of which, is the fact that some pretty heavy hitters are using the terms and in turn influencing many others to think along similar narrow minded lines. No doubt many if not all of us have had the unfortunate opportunity to work with some difficult folk, but labelling and discarding them helps no-one." The article encourages empathy and staying focused on someone's humanity. 

- [Building and Scaling a Distributed and Inclusive Team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLBzScQzZ83I81fnpqX2AkYD5c5cKgrqc2&v=XAU5q-biY28) (video) - by Matthias Meyer.

- [Building Software with the Empathy Spectrum](http://corgibytes.com/blog/2016/05/27/empathy-spectrum/) - by Andrea Goulet. Empathy is a skill, and requires context and cultivation. Leaders are wise to master it. "Empathy is a competitive advantage. It helps us build better products and solve better problems by getting to the heart of what’s important to those of us who are human — connection to each other. As leaders, it’s our job to build software organizations where empathy is encouraged and people can grow both intellectually and emotionally."

- [Changing Company Culture Requires a Movement, Not a Mandate](https://hbr.org/2017/06/changing-company-culture-requires-a-movement-not-a-mandate) - by Bryan Walker and Sarah A. Soule. Takeaway: "[C]ulture change can’t be achieved through top-down mandate. It lives in the collective hearts and habits of people and their shared perception of 'how things are done around here.' Someone with authority can demand compliance, but they can’t dictate optimism, trust, conviction, or creativity." This also applies to the best-intentioned culture changes, including agile transformations. You might have the best intentions in the world, but if your team doesn't see the value or direction of the change, don't expect them to adapt.

- [The Company Isn’t a Family](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-company-isnt-a-family-d24f26c3f3fe) - by David Heinemeier Hansson. Takeaway: "Whenever executives talk about how their company is really like a big ol’ family, beware. They’re usually not referring to how the company is going to protect you no matter what or love you unconditionally. You know, like healthy families would. The motive is rather more likely to be a unidirectional form of sacrifice: Yours."

- [Creating the Dream Team: Transform Your Engineering Organization to Attract New Talent](http://blog.carbonfive.com/2015/09/16/creating-the-dream-team-transform-your-engineering-organization-to-attract-new-talent/) - by Andrew Hao. Takeaway: Start with evaluating your current culture's strengths and weaknesses. Be in tune with your org. Make sure you demonstrate that you value employees—whether that is talking up their accomplishments, investing in training, or just being there to talk.

- [Creating Psychological Safety: Start with Trust](https://medium.com/@Alyss/creating-psychological-safety-part-1-ac9aa733fa9b) by Alyss Noland. Takeaway: Psychological safety is a combination of trust between coworkers and an environment where that trust can be acted upon. Start with building those bridges between peers, providing managerial support, and creating a strategic narrative that uplifts every team's accomplishments.

- [Crush the Wall!…of your Departments to Build 100% Agile Company. This Is How We Did It](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/crush-wallof-your-departments-build-100-agile-company-tomas-laboutka) - by Tomas Laboutka. Takeaway: "Without full alignment and team empowerment, a company will not be able to make good decisions and execute quickly. Some studies point out that for every 1 hour of work done by product teams, 48 minutes is spent waiting for a decision to be made. That means in one 8-hour day, 3.5 hours is dedicated to waiting. This is crazy."

- [Culture Is the Spec, Process Is the Code](https://medium.com/@richarmstrong/culture-is-the-spec-process-is-the-code-ccb0df70514f) - by Rich Armstrong. Takeway: Create every process around your culture. Just like your devs need specs in order to know what code to write, your company needs processes in order to implement culture.

- [Hard to communicate with other teams? Check out these tips](https://opensource.com/open-organization/17/7/communicate-teams-tips) - by Jonas Rosland. Takeaway: "[L]earning more about why a team is working on a specific project, not just focusing on how they're involved and what the project is about, can help you foster better relationships across your organization. Focusing on why people act the way they do allows teams to better understand one another's goals and purposes, and helps everyone assume the best intentions from everyone involved in an effort."

- [Hearts and Minds: Shaping Dev Culture Through Technical Training](https://medium.com/@karen_meep/hearts-and-minds-shaping-dev-culture-through-technical-training-3c9c6ed49ce6) - by Karen Cohen. Takeaway: "[W]e have to make sure we don’t lose our culture. Left unattended, it will turn into ‘null culture’. It’s what happens when no formal culture is put into place. It leaves people guessing what is socially acceptable and creates an impossible environment for those who guess wrong. It’s not the type of environment that makes employees want to stick around."

- [How Netflix Reinvented HR](http://hbr.org/2014/01/how-netflix-reinvented-hr/ar/pr) - by Patty McCord. Takeaway: Hire only people who are able to put your company’s interests first.

- [How to Get Engineering Teams to Eat Their Vegetables](https://medium.com/@duretti/how-to-get-engineering-teams-to-eat-their-vegetables-83e0f83af71a) - by Duretti Hirpa.

- [Innovation vs. Execution](http://svpg.com/innovation-vs-execution/) - by Marty Cagan. Takeaway: Not many companies are good at both innovation and execution. Assess your company in terms of both, and decide which one comes first.

- [Lessons from 7 Highly Successful Software Engineering Cultures](https://techbeacon.com/lessons-7-highly-successful-software-engineering-cultures) - by Mitch Pronschinske. Takeaway: Common themes across these seven engineering cultures include removing everything that hinders productivity; having as few rules as possible; hiring adults; having smaller teams and shorter projects; being kind and modest; not focusing on blaming, and focusing on learning from mistakes. Dan Pink's autonomy, mastery, and purpose are also common themes. Diversity is also important for some of these companies because, as research shows, diverse teams are more effective than homogeneous ones.

- [Let’s Talk About Your Plan to Run A Consequence-Free Company](https://mfbt.ca/lets-talk-about-your-plan-to-run-a-consequence-free-company-72ff4a095fec) - by Johnathan Nightingale. Takeaway: "The failure to be basically decent, and to build an organization that values decency, builds up. Like technical debt, it comes more from ignorance and expediency than malice. Some leaders are sociopaths, no doubt, but I think most would insist that they aren’t trying to make things awful. They just never bothered to give enough of a shit to make them better."

- [Netflix Onboarding/Welcome Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bXrsLL9wwtbudLjnoG3F6J-NBcTTQ6KnGpukrSDmjW4) - by Roy Rapoport. Takeaway: Set clear expectations with your directs.
 
- [On Failure and Resilience](https://beero.ps/2017/06/17/on-failure-and-resilience/) - by Katherine Daniels. Takeaway: "It can be a challenge if you’re starting with or coming from a 'blame and train' or 'blame and shame' culture to a 'blameless' or 'blame-aware' one, but the focus on desired outcome and how people can work together to help resolve a situation in the moment, as well as make the systems involved better equipped to handle situations in the future, can do wonders for system and organizational resilience."

- [The Power of an Agile Mindset](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/agile-mindset) (video) - by Linda Rising. Takeaway: The agile mindset will enable you to see problems as failures as opportunities for learning.

- [Programming Is Forgetting: Toward a New Hacker Ethic](http://opentranscripts.org/transcript/programming-forgetting-new-hacker-ethic/) - by Allison Parrish. Takeaway: "Every practice, whether technical or artistic, has a history and a culture, and you can’t understand the tools without understanding the culture and vice versa. Computer programming is no different."

- [Reorgs Happen](http://whilefalse.blogspot.co.il/2015/12/reorgs-happen.html) - by Camille Fournier. Takeaway: "Reorgs are unlikely to solve all of your problems overnight. They are not a magic bullet exercise that fixes cultural issues or a lack of business strategy. If you aren't careful, your reorg will feel like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic, a pointless waste of time for everyone involved. So don't be afraid to do them as necessary, but be realistic. This is a major disruption that impacts everyone, don't just do it for fun."

- [Respect for People - Lean's Neglected Pillar](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/respect-lean) (video) - by Jon Terry, of LeanKit. Takeaway: What "respect for people" means is open to interpretation. Reading a lot of books and articles isn't a quick-fix to understanding it. Understanding that people are motivated by purpose and staying in touch with continuous improvement helps to reinforce respect for people.

- [Sorry, but Your Start-Up’s Team Isn’t Actually Any More Agile Than the Big Guys. Why You Really Still Can Win](https://www.saastr.com/sorry-but-your-start-ups-team-isnt-actually-any-more-agile-than-the-big-guys-why-you-really-still-can-win/) - by Jason Lemkin. Takeaway: "The BigCo problem is a combination of (x) impact/runway and (y) cross-functionality “unagility”.  Here’s where start-ups can execute so much better."

- [Transforming from Projects to Products](https://www.infoq.com/articles/transform-projects-products) - by John Yorke. Takeaway: "Agile Transformation means thinking of Products rather than Projects. Agile is a Mindset not a set of rules to be followed. It requires a cultural change not a process change. Agile changes the way we measure project success and how we measure people's behaviour. Change is Hard. Project Management and People Management are those that need to change the most."

- [Understanding the Limits of Hierarchies](https://opensource.com/open-organization/16/3/fastest-result-isnt-always-best-result?sc_cid=701600000011jJkAAI) - by Jim Whitehurst, CEO of RedHat. Takeaway: "Leading an open organization—where hierarchy cedes much of its control to dynamic, networked structures—feels much more like maintaining a perennial garden. It involves working more on conditions (turning soil, locating those spots in need of watering) than it does on dictating direction. It means creating the context for things (things you might not have considered or even imagined) to occur."

- [Up or Out: Solving the IT Turnover Crisis](http://thedailywtf.com/articles/Up-or-Out-Solving-the-IT-Turnover-Crisis) - by Alex Papadimoulis.

- [What Company Culture IS and IS NOT](https://moz.com/rand/what-company-culture-is-and-is-not/) - by Rand. Takeaway: "Your company’s culture is three big things: Your values – those you state with words and those you exhibit through your actions[;] your mission & vision – the goal you’re driving toward and the force behind that goal[;] your hiring, firing, and promotion criteria – the reasons you bring people onto the team, the reasons you let them go, and the reasons you promote/reward them[.] If you’re trying to figure out what a company’s values really are, look at the decisions management makes when lots of money, risk, or loss of face for executives is at odds with the stated values."

- [What Does It Mean to Be a Learning Organization?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15xrkf9fC2cf9g7joK9ZXA16_Qd77PzxjJRjH-RIJpeQ) - by Joe Goldberg. Takeaway: "You're either building a learning organization or you'll be losing to someone who is."

By creating a team climate that encourages people to embrace potentially risky contributions, the team will be rewarded with better decisions, motivated members, and improved performance."

- [Working On The Right Thing](https://medium.com/redbubble/working-on-the-right-thing-faeb1af73cfe) - by Tom Sommer. A lot of happiness and productivity is thrown away because some of your employees are mismatched to the tasks they work on. By assessing our team on Ability, Affinity and Ambition we can do better.

Takeway: "What’s often ignored is that diversity is not only a pipeline or recruiting issue. It’s an issue of making the people who do make it through the pipeline want to stay at your company." Write a code of conduct no matter the size of your company, to create norms that ideally make your workplace safe.
