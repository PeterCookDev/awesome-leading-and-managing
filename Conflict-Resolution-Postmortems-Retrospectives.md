### Conflict Resolution

- [Overcome the 5 Dysfunctions of a Team](https://medium.com/the-mission/part-2-overcome-the-5-dysfunctions-of-a-team-ef922309f8b5) : by The Mission. Takeaway: 1. It takes time to build trust in a team. 2. Never fear conflict, as "the only purpose of productive conflict is to produce the best solution in the shortest period of time." 3. Commitment is a function of two things: clarity and buy-in. Great teams move forward with complete buy-in, including members who voted against the decision. Therefore, leaders must be comfortable with the prospect of making a decision that turns out to be wrong. 4. Leaders must create a culture of accountability in/to the team by encouraging and allowing the team to serve as the first and primary accountability mechanism. 5. Leaders must set the tone for the team to focus on results. If the team members sense that the leader values anything other than results, they will take that as permission to do the same.

- [Why Airbnb Encourages Employees to Predict Its Own Downfall](http://www.inc.com/adam-vaccaro/airbnb-demise.html) - by Adam Vaccaro.

Takeaway: "[T]raditional approaches to retrospectives – assembling a group people in a room with one or more facilitators – are too costly, don’t scale, take far too long and fail to produce high-impact results. As a consequence, large organizations either skip retrospectives entirely or they relegate retrospectives to individual teams, which tragically limit their effectiveness in identifying and implementing enterprise changes that can profoundly improve performance. Over time, because individual teams are not obtaining material benefits from retrospectives, they stop doing them at all." Using online games can be a less expensive option.
