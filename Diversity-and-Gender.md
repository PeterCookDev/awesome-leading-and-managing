- [Argument Cultures and Unregulated Aggression](https://www.kateheddleston.com/blog/argument-cultures-and-unregulated-aggression) - by Kate Heddleston. Takeaway: Using arguments as a tool for decision-making hurts creativity and diversity. Unregulated arguments create hostile work environments by promoting a win-at-all-costs attitude.

- [Atlassian Boosted Its Female Technical Hires By 80% — Here’s How](http://firstround.com/review/atlassian-boosted-its-female-technical-hires-by-80-percent-heres-how/) - by First Round Review. Takeaway: Start on inclusion and diversity as early as possible. Get your management board to commit to inclusion and diversity. Evaluate what is causing exclusion and plan how to address the causes. Have clear guidelines for promotions and job roles.

- [Authenticity at Work Is a Privilege](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/authenticity-work-privilege) - by Roseanne Malfucci at ThoughtWorks. Takeaway: "Free snacks and a lax dress code do not spell freedom for minoritized technologists like me, who instead spend our days walking many small tightropes, while also trying to do our actual jobs. How can we create a culture where 'bringing your whole self to work' is an option for a broader range of people?"

- [Beginning with Ourselves: Using Data Science to Improve Diversity at Airbnb](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/beginning-with-ourselves-48c5ed46a703) - by Riley Newman and Elena Grewal. Takeaway: Airbnb managed to increase the number of women in the company from 15% to 30% by analyzing and improving their recruiting practices.

- [Being an Effective Ally to Women and Non-Binary People](https://codeascraft.com/2016/10/19/being-an-effective-ally-to-women-and-non-binary-people/) - by Toria Gibbs and Ian Malpass. Takeaway: "Relying on members of minority groups to shoulder the burden of diversity issues is just as flawed as expecting one person to do all the work to fix a broken deploy system. You can’t excel at your job when you spend half your time dealing with other stuff. We need ways of spreading the load. We need allies. And we hope that’s why you’re reading this now."

- [Criticism and Ineffective Feedback](https://www.kateheddleston.com/blog/criticism-and-ineffective-feedback) - by Kate Heddleston. Takeaway: Research shows that more critisism and negative feedback is given to women. In order to boost people's performance, it is best to give positive feedback. If we want people to improve or change, it is best to tell them what exactly to do as opposed to what not to do.

- [Diversity Debt: How Much Does Your Startup Have?](https://medium.com/@abarrica/startups-diversity-debt-and-what-to-do-about-it-cd385364506#.37de3laye) - by Andrea Barrica. Takeaway: "In the same way that engineers can accrue “technical debt” when they push out sloppy code, or business owners can accrue “bookkeeping debt” when they procrastinate their financials until tax time, companies can also accrue diversity debt over their life cycle. The more people your company hires until you have a diverse team (meaning an array of genders, LGBT, socio-economic backgrounds, ethnicities, ages, able-bodiedness, etc.) — the more diversity debt your organization has accrued."

- [5 Strategies for Being an Ally to Women in Tech](https://austinstartups.com/5-strategies-for-being-an-ally-to-women-in-tech-d4b51e5e4fcf) - by Joy Ebertz. Takeaway: 1) Look who does your "housework" tasks; 2) be mindful of the peer feedback you give; 3) help make sure people are credited with their ideas; 4) create space for others in meetings; 5) make sure team-building is inclusive.

- [For an Inclusive Culture, Try Working Less](https://hackernoon.com/for-inclusive-culture-maybe-less-is-more-87b663662cea) - by Rich Armstrong. Takeaway: "When our office culture is focused on business rather than socializing, we reduce the number of ways in which we all have to be the same. When we do that, we allow diversity to flourish. If your culture expects people to work long hours or hang out off-hours, the strain on the people who are different, in whatever way, is increased, and your ability to retain a diverse work force is reduced."

- [How Fragile Deployments Hurt Diversity](https://home.opsolutely.com/how-your-bad-engineering-tooling-is-hurting-your-ability-to-hire-diversity/) - by Kate Heddleston. Takeaway: "Here are two things that are true: the single most expensive thing on your engineering team is engineers, and fragile teams are terrible places to work. Which means – the biggest problem with fragile deployments isn’t just that your code might break; the real problem is that you will lose your valuable engineers because of bad workplace culture. In the long run, a broken culture can be more costly than outages. It can even kill your business."

- [How Men and Women See the Workplace Differently](http://graphics.wsj.com/how-men-and-women-see-the-workplace-differently/) - by Nikki Waller. A *Wall Street Journal* article on a study conducted by LeanIn.org and MicKinsey. "Data show that men win more promotions, more challenging assignments and more access to top leaders than women do. Men are more likely than women to feel confident they are en route to an executive role, and feel more strongly that their employer rewards merit."

- [If You Can Use a Fork, You’re “Technical”](https://medium.com/@Aprilw/if-you-can-use-a-fork-youre-technical-352e21d92c87) - by April Wensel. Takeaway: "'Technical' is not a useful adjective to describe human beings," because it's vague; it hides bias in hiring decisions; it blocks technical contributions from "non-technical" employees; and limits potential. "There’s no magic to coding or any other technical skills. People are not 'technical' or 'not technical.' We all have a variety of skills already and the potential to learn any others that we choose."

Takeaway: The author describes how poor management can stall one's career. Chaos, lack of empathy, biased feedback ("you're too aggressive/pushy/complaining") are all factors the author faced. "...I can’t help feeling that a man would have been treated differently. Perhaps there was unconscious bias at play; perhaps I didn’t act the way women should, and this bothered people. Despite my asking for bigger opportunities, I saw project after project handed to my peers instead of me. Without opportunities to do important work, my career stalled."

- [Onboarding and the Cost of Team Debt](https://kateheddleston.com/blog/onboarding-and-the-cost-of-team-debt) - by Kate Heddleston. Takeaway: Lack of onboarding hurts mostly those who are different from the rest of the team. Onboarding can improve diversity as new hires will feel more integrated.

- [The Null Process](https://kateheddleston.com/blog/the-null-process) - by Kate Heddleston. Takeaway: The lack of a clear promotion process creates an informal process for promotions that favors men.

- [What Does Sponsorship Look Like?](http://larahogan.me/blog/what-sponsorship-looks-like/) - by Lara Hogan. Takeaway: The former Etsy leader and current Kickstarter lead talks about shifting focus from mentoring to sponsoring as a way to change the ratio. "When privileged people begin to see the systems of bias and privilege, their first instinct typically is to mentor those who haven’t benefited from the same privilege. ... What members of underrepresented groups in tech often need most is opportunity and visibility, not advice."

- [Why Diverse Teams Are Smarter](https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter) - by David Rock and Heidi Grant. Takeaway: Studies by McKinsey and others suggest that diversity can positively affect financial returns for companies. Other studies show that diverse teams are more objective, process information more carefully, and become more innovative than homgeneous teams. This seems natural, given that diverse views and backgrounds will lead to a broader range of perspectives as well as debate and refinement of ideas.

- [Why Diversity Matters](http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters) - by Vivian Hunt, Dennis Layton, and Sara Prince at McKinsey & Co. Takeaway: "[C]ompanies in the top quartile for gender or racial and ethnic diversity are more likely to have financial returns above their national industry medians. Companies in the bottom quartile in these dimensions are statistically less likely to achieve above-average returns. And diversity is probably a competitive differentiator that shifts market share toward more diverse companies over time."

- [Women in Tech: We Need You](https://dev.to/binarycodess/women-in-tech-we-need-you) - by Kristina. A request to women to speak publicly, mentor, and become a role model.
