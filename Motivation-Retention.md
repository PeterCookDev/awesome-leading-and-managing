- [3 Simple Secrets to Motivating Employees You Can Do Today](https://getlighthouse.com/blog/motivating-employees) - by Lighthouse.

Purpose: yearning to do something larger than ourselves—e.g., hospital janitor as “ambassador” or “promote healing by creating sterile places.”

- [Building and Motivating Engineering Teams](https://medium.com/swlh/building-and-motivating-engineering-teams-24fd56910039) - by Camille Fournier. Takeaway:

  1. **Money:** When you don’t pay people well enough, you contribute to undermining their resilience in the face of problems at work. Think of it as the baseline of [Maslow’s hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs).
  2. **Purpose:** There are always technical challenges to be found in organizations, but you’re probably not building a company with a bunch of insanely hard tech problems. This means you have to work harder to sell the learning opportunities. Let engineers into the non-technical decision-making processes.
  3. **Respect:** Respect that engineers are smart individuals who often have more to add to your business than just their coding talents. Teach them to respect that the other parts of the business have equally valuable skills and perspectives. Engineers don’t need to feel like the company royalty to be inspired to do good work, but they do need the opportunity to be treated like a partner.

- [The 3 Motivational Forces of Developers](http://www.bennorthrop.com/Essays/2013/developer-motivation.php) - by Ben Northrop. Takeaway: Developers have three main different motivations, and each motivation can be used in different states of a project life-cycle.

  1. **Business Motivated:** Driven most by a desire to get things done for the customer; have a can-do attitude. In terms of code, they think more concretely, and aren't always the best at creating abstractions that support reuse or other non-functional goals. They just want to get things done and see a functional product.
  2. **Technology Motivated:** Love learning new things for its own sake; eager to find the newest framework, language, or methodology and will take every opportunity to try it out on their current project. Know all the trending technologies, and have probably dabbled with them over nights and weekends. On a greenfield project they thrive, but when the field turns "brown" and new code turns into legacy, they look for greener pastures, or—possibly worse—seek ways to shoehorn in technology even if it's to the detriment of the system.
  3. **Problem Motivated:** Hard problems excite these developers, independent of which technology is employed or even if it adds value for the business. It's all about the puzzle. Coming up with an elegant, clever, or quality solution is the victory. While their solutions are solid, sometimes the details slip.

Takeaway: "According to Gallup's research, 9 of the 12 workplace elements consistently predict turnover across business units, regardless of an organization's size. These elements are: having clear expectations, having the materials and equipment to do the job right, having the opportunity to do what you do best every day, the belief that someone at work cares, the belief that someone encourages your development, a sense that your opinions count, the mission or purpose of the company making you feel that your job is important, a belief that your coworkers are committed to quality, and having opportunities to learn and grow at work. If these needs are met, as shown by higher scores on these employee engagement items, turnover is likely to be low."
