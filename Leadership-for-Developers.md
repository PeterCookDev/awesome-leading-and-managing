### Software Craftspersonship

- [Active Learner — How Developers Keep Learning](https://medium.com/dennis-nerush/active-learner-how-developers-keep-learning-1309b91f1ae6) - by Dennis Nerush. Takeaway: "the kind of developers we want to hire and be part of our company and our teams ... are not expert beginners and they are not necessary real experts. But they are aware of what they know and most importantly, what they don’t know. They are on the path to someday become real experts. To go in this path they cannot rely only on what their job teaches them and 'out of the box' just working solutions—they must actively learn."

- [The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073/ref=pd_sim_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0137081073&pd_rd_r=ZG5XBXBXACNY81TG4FXM&pd_rd_w=0mdSO&pd_rd_wg=so42p&psc=1&refRID=ZG5XBXBXACNY81TG4FXM) - by Uncle Bob Martin. A practical guide for how to become a software craftsperson.

- [Empathy - The Hidden Ingredient of Good Software Development (video)](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/86154111) - by Daniel Bryant. Takeaway: "When gathering requirements and performing business analysis, it is obvious that the ability to experience from within another user/customer/being's frame of reference is a valuable skill, but the same can be said when writing code. If we follow Martin Fowler’s train of thought where 'any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand' we can see that empathy is at the heart of this skill."

- [First Thoughts on Developer Gravity](http://redmonk.com/jgovernor/2017/07/28/first-thoughts-on-developer-gravity/) - by James Governor. Takeaway: A post that's a kickoff to future exploration, but already offers insights about "developer gravitiy" (where devs "live") and the importance of developer experience (which decreases with poor documentation, bug fixes and examples). "Developers are certainly not immune to the perception of momentum for environments they might target. Tensor Flow, for example, is seen as a hot technology. GitHub makes developer momentum more obvious than ever. 25k forks – sign me up! Developers want to adopt technologies than other developers find interesting. Herd mentality is a thing."

- [The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable](http://www.bip.org.bd/SharingFiles/11-The%20Five%20Dysfunctions%20of%20a%20Team.pdf) - by Patrick Lencioni.

Takeaway: "[A]s a submitter, plan, tell the story, and use the review as a learning experience. As a reviewer, slow down, check carefully, automate as much as you can and take the opportunity to improve your team."

- [Habits vs Goals: a Look at the Benefits of a Systematic Approach to Life](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/06/habits-vs-goals/) - by Farnham Street. Practical advice about focusing on forming habits—which promote continuous improvement—instead of achieving goals, which have an endpoint.

- [How Do I Convince...?](https://codurance.com/2017/06/13/how-do-I-convince/) - by Sandro Mancuso of Codurance. Takeaway: "One of the biggest mistakes we make as developers is to think that adopting certain practices is a goal that all teams and organisations should have. Technical practices and methodologies are a means to an end and not a goal on their own. They are the 'how,' not the 'why.' Before pushing a practice or methodology to a team or organisation, we should make sure that everyone understands the problem we are trying to solve - the 'why.' ... Don’t discuss practices. Discuss the value you would like to provide and walk backwards."

- [How Do You Know Your Code Is Bad?](https://dev.to/bob/how-do-you-know-your-code-is-bad) - by Dinesh Babu. Takeaway: "When you write code, ask yourselves these questions: Is this code too rigid? Is it possible to change the internals of this module in the future without touching the code in other modules and other layers? Is this code too fragile? Will it be hard to find all the places to refactor for any changes in the future? Should this feature be reusable? If so, does this code depends on any unwanted modules or frameworks that can be avoided?"

- [Satisficery Engineering](http://baggerspion.net/2017/08/satisficery-engineering/) - by Paul Adams, Zalando. Takeaway: looks at the topic of "Push." How do we know when to push a team—and in which direction? Sometimes asking a team to deliver more is appropriate but, likewise, it can also be appropriate to give them a break. This article is about being mindful of these opportunities and their consequences.

- [Speed in Software Development](https://www.targetprocess.com/articles/speed-in-software-development/) - by Michael Dubakov. Takeaway: "Software development pace / productivity / speed is a complex, interdependent and multifaceted concept. It has no easy solution. You can’t shout at people “work faster!” You can’t blindly cut corners and focus on value added activities only. The only solution is to think deeply about the company, development processes, people, tools, etc. Build a model and think."

- [Start from Square Zero: Hidden Habits You Need for a Successful Career in Tech](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/start-from-square-zero-hidden-habits-you-need-for-a-successful-career-in-tech-3e4b86636d6) - by Andrea Goulet.

The post offers suggestions for what teams can do.

- [Makers and Menders: Putting the Right Developers on the Right Projects (deck)](https://www.slideshare.net/andrea_goulet/makers-and-menders-putting-the-right-developers-on-the-right-projects) - by Andrea Goulet, CEO & Co-Founder of Corgibytes. Takeaway: Makers and menders each have valuable roles to play in development. Focusing too much on making leads to maintenance, "legacy code," and technical debt; mend as well to reduce your overhead.

- [9 Attributes of Successful Development Teams](https://about.gitlab.com/2017/05/23/attributes-of-successful-development-teams/) - by Rebecca Dodd at GitLab.

Takeaway: a summary of Thornhill's QCon London 2017 talk, which covered "methods to identify 'hotspots' of code complexity and churn; the benefit of continually evaluating the suitability of the architecture for the current system, for example, by examining 'temporal coupling' of components or microservices; and that the cost of inter-team coordination can often be learned from examining the social metadata associated with code commits within a version control system."

- [A Seamless Way to Keep Track of Technical Debt in Your Source Code](http://philippe.bourgau.net/a-seamless-way-to-keep-track-of-technical-debt-in-your-source-code/) - by Philippe Bourgau. Takeaway: use TODO comments as a good starting point for tracking technical debt.

Takeaway: "If we’re not running our own environments in house, operations disposability become increasingly realistic. Cattle not pets, for everything. But convenience and disposability always incur a cost."

- [Technical Debt: Adding Math to the Metaphor](http://reinertsenassociates.com/technical-debt-adding-math-metaphor/) - by Donald Reinertsen.
